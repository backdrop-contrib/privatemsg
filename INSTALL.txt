Readme
------

This is my first Drupal module: a very basic private messaging module.
It allows your site's visitors to send private messages to each other.
It does not use Jabber at all (but could be fun to use it).

Features:
 - read/write/delete messages
 - reply to message with quoting
 - new messages support (block and page)
 - folders
 - pruning
 - contact list
 - option to get mail if you have unread messages

If you want to create a link to send a user a message, use:
l(t("send private message"), "privatemsg/new/$user->uid"))

Send comments to marco@porciletto.org.


Requirements
------------
This module requires Drupal 4.7+.


Installation
------------

1. Copy the files to the Drupal modules/privatemsg directory. Drupal should automatically detect it. Enable in administration/site configuration/modules.

2. Check "access private messages" in "roles and permissions" in the administration; anonymous users should not have permission. You can also change something in "settings and filters".

3. Enjoy!

Upgrading
---------

If you are upgrading from versions before 29-Apr-2005, you will need to run the
appropriate SQL statements from the privatemsg.install file.  Open the file in a
text editor to determine which statements you will need to run.
