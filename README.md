# Privatemsg

Privatemsg allows your site's visitors to send private messages
to each other. Perfect for community oriented sites, such as forums
and social networking sites. Many additional features are available
as separate modules.


## Status

This is a port to Backdrop of the Drupal module, version 7.x-1.4.
It is currently under development.

**Warning**: This module has major bugs, and it may crash
your website. Do not use on production websites.

## Features

    + send and receive private messages on a site
      (between multiple recipients)
    + threaded conversations (make it easier to keep
      track of messages and replies)
    + search private messages
    + tagging and filtering (helps organise conversations)
    + user blocking
    + e-mail notifications of new messages

The Privatemsg module allows users to send messages to each other
without having to share their e-mail addresses. Once the module
has been enabled, an inbox link will appear in the navigation menu.
"Write to author" links are included in posts, allowing users to write
private messages instead of commenting openly. Allowing users to
communicate directly with each other is an important part of
community building.

Optionally, users can select whether to receive email notices of new
messages by editing their user profiles. The contacts list contains
only users that you have previously messaged. To contact users not in
your list, you need to know their Backdrop usernames. Administrators
can set messaging options such as frequency of emails, message status
display, and number of messages to display per page. They can also
configure 'Write to Author' options.
