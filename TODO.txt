TODO:
- messages should be nodes (not a good idea, perfomance wise)
- get rid of javascript (now used very few, just in contact list)
- sort messages per author/date/ecc
- mix with mail (receive a mail in your mailbox, answer by email)
- option to have every message sent in a central box even from other sites
- help and info
- some watchdogs if someone tries something stupid/bad (e.g. delete someone else's messages)

doubts:
- is author to index?
- preview message before sending(?)
- change links (write new, reply, delete, etc) to form buttons?
- admin with message search?
- admin to probe messages (?)

other ideas:
- integration with jabber(?)
- filters
